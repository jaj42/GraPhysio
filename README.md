# GraPhysio
GraPhysio is a graphical data visualizer for physiologic data signals
from ICU patient monitors.

## Install instructions
To make GraPhysio work you need Python version >=3.4 as well as PyQt.
GraPhysio makes heavy use of scientific Python libraries like Pandas,
NumPy and SciPy. Plotting relies on the excellent PyQtGraph library.
You may want to install one of the scientific Python packages like
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) if you don't want to
manually handle the dependencies. Make sure to grab the Python 3
version.

You can then install the latest version of GraPhysio by tying the
following command:

> pip install graphysio

You can launch GraPhysio by typing:

> graphysioui.py
